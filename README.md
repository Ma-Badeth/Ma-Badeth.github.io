### Volleyball

**What is volleyball?**
> Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules

> The objective of the game is for each team to send the ball over the net to ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded on its own court. The ball is put into play by the serving player.

## Player Positions



### Setter

### Middle Blockers

> -On defense, the Middle Blocker position is the player at the net in the middle of the court between the two outside blockers. 
> The middle blocker strives to be involved in blocking the opponent's hitters wherever they may be on the court.

### Libero

> -in indoor volleyball is a back-row defensive specialist. Since they only play in the back row, those players are often shorter 
> than the front-row blockers and hitters but have impeccable ball-control skills. The position was created to promote ball-control.

> -Liberos are **not** allowed to do any attack hits while inside the court, they are also permitted to set.

### Pinch Server

> -Pinch servers are considered serving specialists. Some serving specialists are subbed in not because the person they are replacing is a poor server,
>  but because it is a crucial moment in the game or the server being subbed in has a serve that will be more effective.
